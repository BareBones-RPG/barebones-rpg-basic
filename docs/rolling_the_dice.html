  <h3>Barebones RPG Basic Mechanic</h3> 
  <p>Each Player Character (PC) has a set of attributes, each represented by a number from 1 to 5. To perform an action tied to an attribute, 
    the player must roll a number equal to or lower than the attribute's value using a six-sided die (d6). If the roll is equal to or less than the attribute, 
    the test is successful. If it is higher, the test fails.</p>
   

<h3>Critical vs. Fumble</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A roll of <strong>1</strong> on a d6 is a <strong>critical success</strong>.</li>
  <li>A roll of <strong>6</strong> on a d6 is a <strong>fumble</strong> (critical failure).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combat Critical Success</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Melee or Missile Attack:</strong> The player automatically deals <strong>Strike damage</strong> (no need to roll for damage).</li>
  <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The player <strong>avoids the attack</strong> and gains a <strong>free counterattack</strong>, rolling damage without needing to roll to hit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combat Fumble</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Melee or Missile Attack:</strong> The player’s <strong>weapon breaks</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The player takes <strong>double damage</strong>, and their <strong>armor is reduced by one tier</strong> (<code>d6 → d4 → d2 → 0</code>).</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Luck</h3>
    <p>Luck is an attribute that players can burn before or after a roll. Players decide how many points to assign to this attribute during character creation. Luck represents a character's ability to twist fate in their favor—rewinding outcomes, bending odds, or pulling off unlikely feats.</p>

<p>Luck can be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain a +2 bonus to a test (before rolling). This increases your chance of success, but not beyond 5-in-6.</li>
<li>Neutralize a fumble (after rolling a 6), turning it into a normal failure.</li>
<li>Automatically deal a Strike when your attack hits—no need to roll for damage.</li>
<li>Act first in initiative for the round, regardless of the roll.</li>
</ul>
