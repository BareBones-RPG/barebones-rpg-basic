### HOW TO PLAY

Each Player Character (PC) has a set of attributes, each represented by a number from 1 to 5. To perform an action tied to an attribute, the player must roll a number equal to or lower than the attribute's value using a six-sided die (d6).

**Example:**  
If a PC has a Might score of 3, they must roll a 3 or less on 1d6 to successfully **force open a door**.

### CHARACTER CREATION

*BareBones RPG* is *system-agnostic and setting-neutral*. Want to play a thief in a high- or low-fantasy world? Go for it. Prefer to be a paranormal investigator in a modern or historical era? Absolutely.

This game is designed to support any genre or tone, whether you're running sword-and-sorcery adventures, gritty noir mysteries, or post-apocalyptic survival tales. *BareBones RPG* gives the Game Master or Referee tools and freedom to shape the world and story using a simple d6-based system.

> The **Game Master or Referee** can help players generate their stats by rolling 3d3. The total becomes a pool of points the player can freely distribute among their attributes.

**Optional Rule:** Instead of rolling, the Referee may assign a flat number of points—**6 for gritty games** and **8 for heroic campaigns**.

**Example:**  
If the Referee rolls a 1, 2, and 2, the total is 5. The player then has 5 points to assign across their four attributes however they choose, within the limits of character creation.

After assigning attributes, the player and Referee discuss the setting and choose an archetype that aligns with the character’s concept and the tone of the campaign.

### LEARNING THE ATTRIBUTES

*BareBones RPG* uses four core attributes to define characters:

**Agility** — *Defend, balance, swim, flee*  
**Insight** — *Perceive, aim, charm, recall knowledge*  
**Might** — *Crush, lift, strike, grapple*  
**Willpower** — *Resist fear, use relics or magic weapons, cast spells, perform rituals*

Each attribute must have a score between **1 and 5**.  

No attribute can begin at **0**, and **no score may exceed 5**—even if the player has points remaining. Any extra points can be discarded or saved at the Referee’s discretion.

---

<!-- TOC link--><a name="game-of-chances"></a>
### GAME OF CHANCES

Each attribute score represents the character’s **chance of success** when attempting an action related to that attribute.

To resolve an action:
- Roll a six-sided die (1d6).
- If the result is **equal to or lower** than the relevant attribute, the action **succeeds**.
- If the result is **higher**, the action **fails**.

Simple, fast, and cinematic.

### GAMEPLAY EXAMPLE

> **Referee:** “You’re in a small room—about five feet by five feet. There’s a single wooden door ahead of you.”  
> **Player Character:** “I’ll check it.”  
> **Referee:** “You approach the door. It looks old and swollen from damp. You try the handle… it’s stuck. What do you want to do?”  
> **Player Character:** “I want to listen at the door to see if I can hear anything on the other side before I open it.”  
> **Referee:** “Being cautious is good. Roll an **Insight test**, Fighter.”  
>  
> *The player rolls 1d6. Their Insight attribute is 2, giving them a 2-in-6 chance of success. They roll a 4—too high. The test fails.*  
>  
> **Referee:** “You hear faint shuffling, but it’s hard to tell if it’s behind the door or just your imagination. What do you do next?”  
> **Player Character:** “I’m going to open the door.”  
> **Referee:** “It’s stuck. Roll a **Might test**, Fighter.”  
>  
> *The player rolls 1d6. Their Might is 3. They roll a 1—a critical success!*  
>  
> **Referee:** “You throw the door open with ease, Fighter—and catch a glimpse of movement beyond. You’re surprised!”  
>  
> *To determine who reacts first, both the Referee and the player roll 1d6.*  
> *The Referee rolls a 5. The player rolls a 2.*  
>  
> **Referee:** “The creature is quicker—it’s not surprised. It’s armed and yells in your language: ‘Interloper!’ Prepare for combat.”

### ARCHETYPES

Archetypes help guide character creation by suggesting a playstyle, background, and key attribute focus. Each archetype leans into a particular type of action or role within the group.

Players are encouraged to choose an archetype that reflects their character’s strengths, ambitions, or narrative style. These aren't classes—they’re templates for inspiration.

The four core archetypes are:

- **Divine (WILLPOWER):** *Clerics, druids, war priests* — characters connected to divine or primal forces.
- **Fighter (MIGHT):** *Barbarians, gladiators, duelists* — focused on physical strength, weapons, and durability.
- **Magic-User (INSIGHT):** *Illusionists, seers, wizards* — masters of spells, relics, and supernatural lore.
- **Rogue (AGILITY):** *Thieves, swashbucklers, scoundrels* — skilled in stealth, agility, and trickery.

Choose your archetype based on the tone of the game and the character's concept. Archetypes may influence your gear, abilities, or how the Referee adjudicates rolls.

### KIN

In *BareBones RPG*, a character’s **Kin** represents their ancestry or species. Each Kin provides a small mechanical bonus and one flavorful ability that reflects their heritage. Players choose one during character creation.

**Halfling**  
*Small, nimble, and unusually lucky.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility  
**Ability:** Once per session, ignore a single failed roll as if it had succeeded.

**Human**  
*Versatile and adaptable.*  
**Bonus:** +1 to Agility, Insight, Might, or Willpower (player's choice)  
**Ability:** Once per session, justify using a different attribute for a roll. The Referee must agree it makes narrative sense.

**Dwarf**  
*Stubborn, durable, and skilled with stone and steel.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Might  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Might test against poison.

**Elf**  
*Graceful and insightful, attuned to magic and nature.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility or +1 Insight  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Insight test related to recalling ancient knowledge or history.

**Goblin**  
*Clever, crafty, and chaotic.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed trap-related test.

**Half-Orc**  
*Strong, imposing, and fearless.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Might  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Insight test used to intimidate.

### UNDERSTANDING STRIKES

*BareBones RPG* replaces traditional Hit Points (HP) with **Strikes** to simplify combat and reduce bookkeeping. Every character begins with **3 Strikes**.

Weapon damage is still rolled using a damage die. However, a Strike is only marked off if the attacker rolls the **maximum value** on the die.

**Half Strikes** may be used at the Referee’s discretion to represent grazes, shallow cuts, or minor effects (such as a weak trap). These are usually narrative and may:
- Accumulate into a full Strike
- Be ignored entirely based on the game’s tone and style

This system encourages fast-paced, cinematic storytelling over number-crunching.

### CHARACTER SHEET EXAMPLE

Below is an example of a completed character sheet using the **heroic tone** (8 points distributed among attributes):

---

**Name:** Jack Napier  
*A character should have a name—and maybe a title or alias.*

**Archetype:** Thief  
*Jack is agile, sneaky, and knows how to handle traps and underground dealings.*

**Kin:** Human  
*+1 Willpower bonus*  
**Kin Ability:** Once per session, Jack can justify using a different attribute for a roll if it makes narrative sense. The Referee must approve.

**Strikes:** [ ] [ ] [ ]  
*All characters start with 3 Strikes to represent their ability to take damage.*

---

**ATTRIBUTES**

- **Agility:** 3  
- **Insight:** 2  
- **Might:** 2  
- **Willpower:** 1 (+1 from Kin bonus)  

(*Final Willpower score is 2*)

---

**Gear & Weapons**

- Dagger (1d4 damage)  
- Leather Armor (reduces incoming damage by -d2)  
- Thieves’ Tools  
- Worn hooded cloak  

---

This character is built for agility-based actions—sneaking, disabling traps, dodging danger—but can still hold their own in combat or exploration.

### Armor & Weapons

A playable character in BareBones RPG is equipped with armor and weapons—essential gear for those who undertake dangerous tasks like dungeon delving and battling chaotic or evil foes. Armor helps absorb damage, while weapons are used to inflict it. However, a Strike is only dealt when the attacker rolls the maximum value on their weapon’s damage die, whether targeting players or enemies. Non-max rolls may still cause narrative wounds or half Strikes, which the Referee can use to reflect grazes, glancing blows, or minor injuries depending on the tone of the game.

<!--TOC link--><a name="damage"></a>
#### Damage

|Term|Effect|
|---|---|
|Strike|Caused only when the maximum value is rolled on a weapons' die.|
|Half Strike| Narrative effect for minor wounds, may accumulate into a full strike.|
|Armor| Reduces incoming damage. If damage is fully absorbed, no Strike marking occurs.|
|Uarmored|Takes full damage; more likely to suffer strikes if max damage is rolled.| 

<!--TOC link--><a name="combat"></a>
### COMBAT

> **COMBAT Phase 1:** 
> 1. The Referee asks players to declare their actions for the round.
> 2. Roll for group initiative: Referee vs. players. Whoever rolls highest acts first.
> 3. The winning side resolves actions in this order:
>   1. Movement
>   2. Ranged or missile attacks
>   3. Spell casting
>   4. Melee attacks
> 4. The opposing side then resolves their actions in the same order.

**Example Combat:**

> Referee: "You are surprised! The goblins react immediately to your forced entry into the chamber. They're armed and staring down the intruder. Fighter—you were trained for this! Make an AGILITY (Defense) roll."
> 
> Player: "I will! These rag-sacks won't stop me!" (The player has a 2/6 AGILITY)
> 
> The player rolls a 5 on their Defense roll. The goblin hits.
> 
> Referee: Rolls a d4 for the goblin's damage—gets a 4.
> 
> Referee: "The goblin looses an arrow from its poorly made bow. Fighter—roll your armor reduction!"
> 
> Player: "Yes! Maybe it won’t hit as hard." (The fighter rolls 1d2 for leather armor and gets a 2.)
> 
> Player: "I got a two!"
> 
> Referee: "It's just a scratch for now—no Strike taken. Let’s roll for initiative!"

**To-Hit:**
> Referee: "The goblin snarls and steps back, drawing a jagged dagger. You're up, Fighter—what do you do?"
> 
> Player: "I charge and swing my axe right at its neck!" (The Fighter has a MIGHT of 3.)
> 
> Referee: "Alright, roll your MIGHT. You’ll need a 3 or lower to hit."
> 
> The player rolls a 2 — a hit!
> 
> Player: "Yes! Solid hit—now for damage." (The axe deals 1d6. Player rolls a 6 — maximum damage.)
> 
> Referee: "That’s a Strike! You catch the goblin right in the collarbone—it lets out a shriek and stumbles back, blood pouring from the wound. It drops."
> 
> Player: "I press forward, shield up!"
