## 🎲 What Is This Game?

BareBones RPG is a rules-light system designed for fast, imaginative gameplay across any genre—fantasy, noir, sci-fi, or horror. All you need is:

- A d6 (six-sided die)
- Character sheets or index cards
- 2–6 players (including one Referee or Game Master)
- A few tokens or miniatures
- A whole lot of imagination

---

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

- Roll 1d6 against your attributes (1–5).
- If you roll equal to or under the attribute, you succeed.
- Characters start with **3 Strikes** instead of traditional HP.
- Archetypes and Kins shape your role in the world—but you're not bound by rigid classes.
