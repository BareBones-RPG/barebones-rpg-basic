### HOW TO PLAY

Each Player Character (PC) has a set of attributes, each represented by a number from 1 to 5. To perform an action tied to an attribute, the player must roll a number equal to or lower than the attribute's value using a six-sided die (d6).

**Example:**  
If a PC has a Might score of 3, they must roll a 3 or less on 1d6 to successfully **force open a door**.

### CHARACTER CREATION

*BareBones RPG* is *system-agnostic and setting-neutral*. Want to play a thief in a high- or low-fantasy world? Go for it. Prefer to be a paranormal investigator in a modern or historical era? Absolutely.

This game is designed to support any genre or tone, whether you're running sword-and-sorcery adventures, gritty noir mysteries, or post-apocalyptic survival tales. *BareBones RPG* gives the Game Master or Referee tools and freedom to shape the world and story using a simple d6-based system.

> The **Game Master or Referee** can help players generate their stats by rolling 3d3. The total becomes a pool of points the player can freely distribute among their attributes.

**Optional Rule:** Instead of rolling, the Referee may assign a flat number of points—**6 for gritty games** and **8 for heroic campaigns**.

**Example:**  
If the Referee rolls a 1, 2, and 2, the total is 5. The player then has 5 points to assign across their four attributes however they choose, within the limits of character creation.

After assigning attributes, the player and Referee discuss the setting and choose an archetype that aligns with the character’s concept and the campaign's tone.

### LEARNING THE ATTRIBUTES

*BareBones RPG* uses four core attributes to define characters:

**Agility** — *Defend, balance, swim, flee*  
**Insight** — *Perceive, aim, charm, recall knowledge*  
**Might** — *Crush, lift, strike, grapple*  
**Willpower** — *Resist fear, use relics or magic weapons, cast spells, perform rituals*

Each attribute must have a score between **1 and 5**.  

No attribute can begin at **0**, and **no score may exceed 5**—even if the player has points remaining. Any extra points can be discarded or saved at the Referee’s discretion.

---

<!-- TOC link--><a name="game-of-chances"></a>
### GAME OF CHANCES

Each attribute score represents the character’s **chance of success** when attempting an action related to that attribute.

To resolve an action:
- Roll a six-sided die (1d6).
- If the result is **equal to or lower** than the relevant attribute, the action **succeeds**.
- If the result is **higher**, the action **fails**.

Simple, fast, and cinematic.

### GAMEPLAY EXAMPLE

> **Referee:** “You’re in a small room—about five feet by five feet. There’s a single wooden door ahead of you.”  
> **Player Character:** “I’ll check it.”  
> **Referee:** “You approach the door. It looks old and swollen from damp. You try the handle… it’s stuck. What do you want to do?”  
> **Player Character:** “I want to listen at the door to see if I can hear anything on the other side before I open it.”  
> **Referee:** “Being cautious is good. Roll an **Insight test**, Fighter.”  
>  
> *The player rolls 1d6. Their Insight attribute is 2, giving them a 2-in-6 chance of success. They roll a 4—too high. The test fails.*  
>  
> **Referee:** “You hear faint shuffling, but it’s hard to tell if it’s behind the door or just your imagination. What do you do next?”  
> **Player Character:** “I’m going to open the door.”  
> **Referee:** “It’s stuck. Roll a **Might test**, Fighter.”  
>  
> *The player rolls 1d6. Their Might is 3. They roll a 1—a critical success!*  
>  
> **Referee:** “You throw the door open with ease, Fighter—and catch a glimpse of movement beyond. You’re surprised!”  
>  
> *To determine who reacts first, both the Referee and the player roll 1d6.*  
> *The Referee rolls a 5. The player rolls a 2.*  
>  
> **Referee:** “The creature is quicker—it’s not surprised. It’s armed and yells in your language: ‘Interloper!’ Prepare for combat.”

### ARCHETYPES

Archetypes help guide character creation by suggesting a playstyle, background, and key attribute focus. Each archetype leans into a particular type of action or role within the group.

Players are encouraged to choose an archetype that reflects their character’s strengths, ambitions, or narrative style. These aren't classes—they’re templates for inspiration.

The four core archetypes are:

- **Divine (WILLPOWER):** *Clerics, druids, war priests* — characters connected to divine or primal forces.
- **Fighter (MIGHT):** *Barbarians, gladiators, duelists* — focused on physical strength, weapons, and durability.
- **Magic-User (INSIGHT):** *Illusionists, seers, wizards* — masters of spells, relics, and supernatural lore.
- **Rogue (AGILITY):** *Thieves, swashbucklers, scoundrels* — skilled in stealth, agility, and trickery.

Choose your archetype based on the tone of the game and the character's concept. Archetypes may influence your gear, abilities, or how the Referee adjudicates rolls.

<!-- TOC link--><a name="kin"></a>
### KIN

In *BareBones RPG*, a character’s **Kin** represents their ancestry or species. Each Kin provides a small mechanical bonus and one flavorful ability that reflects their heritage. Players choose one during character creation.

**Halfling**  
*Small, nimble, and unusually lucky.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility  
**Ability:** Once per session, ignore a single failed roll as if it had succeeded.

**Human**  
*Versatile and adaptable.*  
**Bonus:** +1 to Agility, Insight, Might, or Willpower (player's choice)  
**Ability:** Once per session, justify using a different attribute for a roll. The Referee must agree it makes narrative sense.

**Dwarf**  
*Stubborn, durable, and skilled with stone and steel.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Might  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Might test against poison.

**Elf**  
*Graceful and insightful, attuned to magic and nature.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility or +1 Insight  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Insight test related to recalling ancient knowledge or history.

**Goblin**  
*Clever, crafty, and chaotic.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Agility  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed trap-related test.

**Half-Orc**  
*Strong, imposing, and fearless.*  
**Bonus:** +1 Might  
**Ability:** Once per session, re-roll a failed Insight test used to intimidate.

<!-- TOC link--><a name="understanding-strikes"></a>
### UNDERSTANDING STRIKES

*BareBones RPG* replaces traditional Hit Points (HP) with **Strikes** to simplify combat and reduce bookkeeping. Every character begins with **3 Strikes**.

Weapon damage is still rolled using a damage die. However, a Strike is only marked off if the attacker rolls the **maximum value** on the die.

**Half Strikes** may be used at the Referee’s discretion to represent grazes, shallow cuts, or minor effects (such as a weak trap). These are usually narrative and may:
- Accumulate into a full Strike
- Be ignored entirely based on the game’s tone and style

This system encourages fast-paced, cinematic storytelling over number-crunching.

### CHARACTER SHEET EXAMPLE

Below is an example of a completed character sheet using the **heroic tone** (8 points distributed among attributes):

---

**Name:** Jack Napier  
*A character should have a name—and maybe a title or alias.*

**Archetype:** Thief  
*Jack is agile, sneaky, and knows how to handle traps and underground dealings.*

**Kin:** Human  
*+1 Willpower bonus*  
**Kin Ability:** Once per session, Jack can justify using a different attribute for a roll if it makes narrative sense. The Referee must approve.

**Strikes:** [ ] [ ] [ ]  
*All characters start with 3 Strikes to represent their ability to take damage.*

---

**ATTRIBUTES**

- **Agility:** 3  
- **Insight:** 2  
- **Might:** 2  
- **Willpower:** 1 (+1 from Kin bonus)  

(*Final Willpower score is 2*)

---

**Gear & Weapons**

- Dagger (1d4 damage)  
- Leather Armor (reduces incoming damage by -d2)  
- Thieves’ Tools  
- Worn a hooded cloak  

---

This character is built for agility-based actions—sneaking, disabling traps, dodging danger—but can still hold their own in combat or exploration.

### Armor & Weapons

A playable character in BareBones RPG is equipped with armor and weapons—essential gear for those who undertake dangerous tasks like dungeon delving and battling chaotic or evil foes. Armor helps absorb damage, while weapons are used to inflict it. However, a Strike is only dealt when the attacker rolls the maximum value on their weapon’s damage die, whether targeting players or enemies. Non-max rolls may still cause narrative wounds or half Strikes, which the Referee can use to reflect grazes, glancing blows, or minor injuries depending on the tone of the game.

<!--TOC link--><a name="damage"></a>
#### Damage

|Term|Effect|
|---|---|
|Strike|Caused only when the maximum value is rolled on a weapons' die.|
|Half Strike| Narrative effect for minor wounds, may accumulate into a full strike.|
|Armor| Reduces incoming damage. If damage is fully absorbed, no Strike marking occurs.|
|Uarmored|Takes full damage; more likely to suffer strikes if max damage is rolled.| 

<!-- TOC link--><a name="combat-phase"></a>
### Combat Phase

Combat in *BareBones RPG* is fast, deadly, and narrative-driven. Every weapon, step, and breath matters. Here's how it flows:

---

#### **1. Roll Initiative (Every Round)**
- At the **start of each combat round**, every participant rolls **1d6** for initiative.
- Highest result acts first.
- On ties, **players act before enemies**.
- **Initiative is re-rolled at the top of every round**, not just once per encounter. This keeps action unpredictable and dynamic.

---

#### **2. Player Turn**
On their turn, a player may:
- **Attack** (roll a MIGHT test for melee or INSIGHT for ranged)
- **Move** (engage, flee, or reposition)
- **Use Gear or Abilities**
- **Perform a Creative Action** (e.g., disarm, trip, shove, bluff)

**To attack:**  
Roll 1d6. If equal to or under the relevant attribute, the attack hits.  
Then roll damage.

---

#### **3. Enemy Turn**
Enemies follow similar rules:
- They act in initiative order.
- **Players always roll to defend** using AGILITY (not the enemy rolling to hit).
- The Referee describes intent; the player rolls to dodge, parry, or avoid.

**Defense Roll:**  
- Roll 1d6.
- If the result is **equal to or under your AGILITY**, you dodge the attack.
- If you fail, the enemy rolls damage.

---

#### **4. Damage and Strikes**
- Weapons roll a damage die (e.g., 1d4, 1d6, etc.).
- A character takes a **Strike** only if the damage die rolls its **maximum value**.
- Armor reduces damage by a die (e.g., -d2). If the max result is no longer reached after reduction, **no Strike is taken**.

**Example:**  
A dagger (1d4) rolls a 4 → potential Strike.  
If leather armor (-d2) reduces it to 2, no Strike occurs.

---

#### Optional: Half Strikes
Referees may apply **Half Strikes** narratively for near misses, grazing hits, or ongoing effects. These can:
- Accumulate into a full Strike, or
- Be ignored for fast-paced play

---

#### Repeat Rounds
After all participants act, **roll initiative again** and start a new round.

Combat ends when:
- All enemies are defeated,
- The party flees,
- Or the narrative changes the stakes.

### Armor List
*BareBones RPG Basic* features a streamlined armor system:

| Armor Type     | Damage Reduction | Examples                  | Notes / Cost |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| None           | —                | *Clothes, rags, robes*     | —            |
| Light Armor    | -d2              | *Leather armor*            | —            |
| Medium Armor   | -d4              | *Chainmail*                | —            |
| Heavy Armor    | -d6              | *Plate armor*              | —            |

In combat, critical attacks and fumbles can alter the flow of battle significantly:
A **critical attack** reduces the target’s armor efficiency. The Referee will rule that the armor’s damage reduction die is reduced by one step (e.g., from -d6 to -d4) for the duration of the encounter or until repaired.

The enemy rolls double damage if a player rolls a fumble (typically a 6 on their Defense roll). In addition, the target's armor reduction is weakened, decreasing its effectiveness by one die step.

> **Example:** A character wearing chainmail (normally -d4 damage reduction) suffers a fumbled defense. The enemy rolls double damage, and the armor reduces damage reduction by only -d2 until repaired.

<!--TOC link---><a name="how-strikes-damage-works"></a>
### How Strike Damage Works

- A weapon only deals a **Strike** if it rolls the **maximum value** on its damage die.  
- If the attack is a **critical hit**, it deals **2 Strikes** instead of 1 on a max roll.  
- All other results are considered minor damage or *narrative-only injuries* (grazes, knocks, etc.).

---

### Tag Definitions

- **Light** — Can be dual-wielded or used for quick attacks.  
- **Finesse** — May use AGILITY instead of MIGHT for attack rolls.  
- **Two-Handed** — Requires both hands to use effectively.  
- **Heavy** — May require 2 MIGHT or more to wield without penalty.  
- **Blunt** — Better against skeletons or unarmored targets.  
- **Armor-Piercing** — Ignores 1 step of Damage Reduction.  
- **Reach** — Can strike from a distance (e.g., second row).  
- **Thrown** — Can be used as a ranged weapon once per round.  
- **Reload** — Must spend a turn to reload after each shot.  
- **Versatile** — Can be used one- or two-handed (GM’s call).  
- **Concealable** — Easy to hide on your person.  
- **Brutal** — Can trigger lingering wounds on a max damage roll.  
- **Chops** — Useful for breaking objects or dismemberment.  
- **Crude** — Common, often improvised or makeshift.
