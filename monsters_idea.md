<!--- Converting OSRs Monster to Barebones RPG--->

This Monster Conversion Kit is designed for use with Old-School Essentials (OSE) or any other OSR-style resource. Follow these simple steps, and you'll be able to convert a monster quickly for use in BareBones RPG.

<!--- Strikes Conversion--->
- Strikes: Divide the creature’s total HP by 3, then **round down**. This determines how many Strikes the monster has.
  *(Example: A monster with 9 HP becomes 3 Strikes. One with 8 HP becomes 2 Strikes.)*
  - If the result is 0, give it a 1 strike minimum.
  - (example: a monster has 8 HP --> 2 Strikes)
 
 <!--- Armor Conversion --->
Use the creature’s **Armor Class (AC)** to determine its **Damage Reduction die**:
- AC 12 or less --> None
- AC 13 - 14 --> -d2
- AC 15 - 16 --> -d4
- AC 17 + --> -d6 or -d8 (Referee's call)
- Some creatures may have different Damage Reduction values based on the weapon type (e.g., bludgeoning vs. piercing).
This adds tactical depth and rewards creative thinking. Letting players discover the right tool for the job can dramatically shift combat in their favor—and feel great when it happens.

<!--- Spell Saving Stat --->
- Spell Saves: Use the monster’s **Petrification** saving throw, divided by 3 (round down), to determine its chance to resist spells.
 *(Example: A Petrification save of 13 becomes a 4-in-6 chance.)*

<!--- 6-in-6 Cap --->
- 6-in-6 Cap: If the calculation results in a 6-in-6 save, reduce it to 5-in-6 for balance. Consider giving the monster an extra Strike to reflect its resilience instead.
