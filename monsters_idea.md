# Making a Monster

<!--- Converting OSRs Monster to Barebones RPG--->

<!--- Strikes Conversion--->
- Strikes: Divide the creature’s total HP by 3, then **round down**. This determines how many Strikes the monster has.
  *(Example: A monster with 9 HP becomes 3 Strikes. One with 8 HP becomes 2 Strikes.)*

<!--- Spell Saving Stat --->
- Spell Saves: Use the monster’s **Petrification** saving throw, divided by 3 (round down), to determine its chance to resist spells.
 *(Example: A Petrification save of 13 becomes a 4-in-6 chance.)*

<!--- 6-in-6 Cap --->
- 6-in-6 Cap: If the calculation results in a 6-in-6 save, reduce it to 5-in-6 for balance. Consider giving the monster an extra Strike to reflect its resilience instead.

# Name:
- **Strikes:** [ ]  
  *(Use format like (3 HP / 3) to track total Strikes. Each Strike = 1 HP.)*

- **Armor:** None / -d2 / -d4 / -d6 / -d8  *Damage Reduction*
  *(Roll to reduce incoming damage.)*

- **Attack:** [Name of attack] (d4 / d6 / d8 / d10 / d12)  
  *(Use the source's listed damage—no conversion needed.)*

- **Save:** For spells, use the creature’s **Petrification** save divided by 3 (round down).  
  *(Example: Petrification 12 → 4-in-6 Save)*
